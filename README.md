## Overview
This project focuses on evaluating and comparing the performance of multiple machine learning models for classification tasks. The evaluation process involves:
- Training models on a given dataset
- Measuring their performance using various metrics
- Comparing results to identify the best-suited model

## Selected Models
### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a simple and effective method for classification, particularly for datasets with linearly separable features. It is computationally efficient and interpretable, making it a great choice for baseline performance evaluation.

### Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique known for its robustness against overfitting and ability to handle complex data patterns. It performs well on high-dimensional datasets and offers feature importance insights.

### Decision Tree
Decision Tree models are intuitive and interpretable, providing clear decision paths. They are computationally efficient and suitable for smaller datasets with well-defined class boundaries.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that works well for smaller datasets. It is simple to implement and provides reasonable performance for data with distinct clusters.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models is assessed using the following metrics:
1. **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.
2. **Precision**: Evaluates the model's ability to identify only relevant instances.
3. **Recall**: Determines the model's ability to capture all relevant instances.
4. **F1 Score**: Provides a balance between precision and recall.
5. **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the performance of classification models in detail.

## Project Goals
1. Compare models to determine their suitability for the given dataset.
2. Identify the trade-offs between models based on computational efficiency, interpretability, and performance.
3. Provide clear and actionable insights on model selection for future applications.

## How to Use
1. **Train Models**:
   - Run the training scripts to fit the selected models on the dataset.
2. **Evaluate Models**:
   - Use the provided evaluation functions to calculate metrics and visualize performance.
3. **Analyze Results**:
   - Compare the metrics to identify the best-performing model.

## Results Summary
The detailed evaluation and comparison of the models are documented in the project's analysis files. Insights are provided to guide the selection of the most appropriate model for classification tasks.
